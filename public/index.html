      <h2>What are the small plates?</h2>
      <p>
        Nevertheless, I have received a commandment of the Lord that I should make these plates, 
        for the special purpose that there should be an account engraven of the ministry of my people. (1 Nephi 3:9)
      </p>
      <p>
        Oh you meant this app? Just as the small plates of Nephi were a record kept and shared by his family while the 
        large plates were kept by the rulers of the people, so will your small plates be a record of your life meant 
        for you and your closests family and friends.
